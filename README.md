# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time, but you're free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality because Moment.js is considered a "legacy" product. Learn more about these other solutions in the [Moment.js project status page.](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/).

## Installation

This does not require installation.

## Usage

This application allows users to choose a time slot to enter a task. These tasks are stored in local storage so they are still accessible even when the application is refreshed. Current date is displayed on the top of the application and the times are color coded to let the user know when an event has passed, current, or in the future.
